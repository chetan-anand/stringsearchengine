Dear everyone,

   I am attaching the question paper of tomorrow's quiz (obviously
password-protected)! Please download it to your lab machine before 2:15
p.m. tomorrow (Wednesday). The password will be informed to you at 2:15 pm
in the lab after Internet connection is disconnected. You need to install
RAR package to uncompress this file.

    About the password...crack it if you can and you would be awarded full
10 marks even if you don't appear at the quiz. The hint for the
password is given in this email.

Thanks,
Saswata
